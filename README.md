# Portfolio Optimization Using the Mean-Variance Framework

## Introduction

Building the best possible investment portfolio is a fundamental goal for investors in the world of finance. During the portfolio optimization process, each asset combination is carefully chosen to optimize predicted return while lowering associated risk. Investors can strive to obtain the best possible trade-off between risk and return by diversifying their investments over a variety of assets.

The `mean-variance` framework is one of the most popular models for portfolio optimization. This framework takes into account the predicted returns and the covariance matrix of asset returns to provide a systematic method for allocating investments.

In this `Python` notebook, we will explore the concept of portfolio optimization using the mean-variance framework and implement it in a practical setting. We will leverage the power of `Python`'s scientific libraries, such as `NumPy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`, to perform the necessary calculations and visualize the results.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Preparation and Preprocessing**: 
   - Gather historical price data for a set of assets.
   - Calculate the corresponding returns.
   - Prepare the data for further analysis.

2. **Mean and Covariance Estimation**: 
   - Calculate the mean returns of the assets.
   - Estimate the covariance matrix of the asset returns.
   - These statistics are crucial inputs for the mean-variance optimization model.

3. **Portfolio Optimization**: 
   - Formulate the optimization problem to find the optimal allocation of assets.
   - Define the objective function, constraints, and optimization algorithm.
   - Solve for the optimal portfolio weights.

4. **Evaluation and Analysis**: 
   - Evaluate the performance of the optimized portfolio.
   - Calculate expected return and risk measures.

5. **Efficient Frontier**: 
   - Plot the efficient frontier, which represents the set of optimal portfolios.
   - The frontier shows the highest expected returns for a given level of risk.
   - This visualization aids in selecting an appropriate portfolio based on an investor's risk appetite.

6. **Hyperparameter Effect: The Influence of the Penalty Weight**: 
   - Analyze the effect of the penalty weight as a hyperparameter in the objective function.
   - Visualize its impact with three different values.

## Getting Started

To get started, ensure you have the required Python libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

Clone this repository and open the notebook to begin your journey into portfolio optimization.
